# js-url-shortener ðŸ”—

A simple URL shortener written in JavaScript.

## Getting setup

1. [Download](https://github.com/robsd/js-url-shortener/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract or fork this repo.
2. Edit the **urls.txt** file with the URLs you wish to shorten in the format `alias => https://shortened.link` (one per line) where *alias* is the end part e.g. yourdomain.com/#link and *https://shortened.link* is the link you wish to shorten.

## Need a hint?

I have created an example shortened URL in **urls.txt** based on the above setup guide which you can demo below.
